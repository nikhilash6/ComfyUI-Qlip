"""Qlip Compile — plan-first compilation of the diffusion model (Loom).

Fifth acceleration axis: the previous nodes cut the AMOUNT of work (sparse
attention, caching, progressive resolution); this one speeds up EXECUTION of
what remains. It discovers the transformer block stacks, compiles each block
class once through torch.compile, memoizes shape-pure glue (RoPE embedders)
and can put every large block Linear on the FP8 path (qlip quantization
scheme: e4m3 + amax scales, executed via native H100/Blackwell scaled GEMM
— no ONNX export, no engine build).

Vs whole-model torch.compile: same steady speed (Z-Image 1024²: 118 ms vs
118.4 tc-default, eager 134.7) but cold start is seconds instead of minutes
and RESOLUTION CHANGES NEED NO RECOMPILE (0.7 s vs 79–156 s). With fp8:
94.7 ms (1.42×), cosine 0.9957 to eager.

Install is LAZY and happens on the FIRST MODEL CALL (unet wrapper) — at
that point weights are guaranteed on the GPU and LoRA patches are applied
(the sampler-level hook fires too early: ComfyUI moves weights to the
device after it). The first run with the node therefore includes one-time
compilation (~10–20 s on top); every later run — and every new resolution —
is fast. With fp8 + calibrate-first-run, the first run doubles as the
calibration pass (max observer); scales freeze at its end and later runs
use static scales, like the TRT-engine deploy.

Compose order: QlipAutoSparse → QlipCompile → QlipCache → QlipProgressive.
Whatever attention/patches are installed when the first model call happens
is what gets compiled; a block that fails to compile permanently falls back
to eager — the run never breaks.
