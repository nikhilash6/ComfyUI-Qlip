"""Qlip Cache — step caching (skip denoising steps) for extra speed.

Third acceleration axis on top of Qlip engines: reuse the model's last real
output when the trajectory moves slowly. Wraps the UNet call via ComfyUI's
official `set_model_unet_function_wrapper` (no monkey-patching), so it works
over FP8/NVFP4/CASA engines and eager alike.

Only useful on MANY-step configs (LTX-2.3 dev 15+, FLUX Klein base 50). On
distilled 4–8 step models there's almost no inter-step redundancy — the node
warns and effectively no-ops.
